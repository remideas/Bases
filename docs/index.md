# Bases module

Bases it's a Roblox Studio module that allows you to sandbox with custom instance classes to do any crazy ideas you can imagine, no metatables needed, just a table in a module script.

I'm trying to improve sandboxing the best I can, if you have any suggestion / idea feel free to tell me about it. If you find any bug I would be very happy that you report it to me.

Heres the github [repository](https://github.com/remideas/Bases).

## It's very simple!

Bases allows you to create custom instance classes without any effort, even a banana can do it! It's just a few lines of code to start working in amazing projects. We will guide you
through in this documents to solve any question you have!

## Why Bases?

You may be asking why you should use Bases over the conventional OOP method? Well Bases it's created around the idea of creating custom **instance** classes. What does this mean?
