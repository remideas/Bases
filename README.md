# Bases
Bases it's a Roblox Studio module that allows you to sandbox with custom instance classes to do any crazy ideas you can imagine, no metatables needed, just a table in a module script.

I'm trying to improve sandboxing the best I can, if you have any suggestion / idea feel free to tell me about it. If you find any bug I would be very happy that you report it to me.
